## Description

This repository provides the Docker images and databases used for the [Learner's Block](https://learnersblock.org) App Store.

Ports 80, 8000, 8080, 9000 and 9090 are used by the Learner's Block operating system and cannot be used for applications. 

## Feature requests

We thrive to ensure the features developed are those most in line with the community's needs. That is why all feature requests are made through our [voting platform](https://vote.learnersblock.org), where users can add ideas and vote for those they feel most important. Please utilise this voting platform rather than adding feature requests to this repository. 

## Contributing

### Pull requests
We welcome contributions, they are what keep the Block alive! For pull requests we suggest discussing the changes through a ticket first. This is for your own sake in case there are already changes ongoing that will affect your contribution. 

If you are looking to contribute but do not have a specific feature or goal in mind, please check the list of [Good First Issues](https://github.com/LearnersBlock/learners-block/contribute) and our [voting platform](https://vote.learnersblock.org), which contains a list of features prioritised by the community.

### Bug reports

For bug reports, please search existing issues before posting a ticket.  

### Donations

As with all community projects, we do incur costs. You can see everything we have spent, everything we have been donated and you can donate through our [funding page](https://docs.learnersblock.org/about-us/how-we-are-funded).
